Commands for react

To create a new React project, use:
npx create-react-app my-app

JSX (JavaScript XML):
JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax in your React components.
Example:
const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;

State and Props:
State holds data that can change within a component:
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

Props allow passing data from parent to child components:
<MyComponent name="John" />

Hooks:
useState for managing state.
useEffect for side effects (e.g., fetching data).
useRef for accessing DOM elements.
Example:
useEffect(() => {
  // Code to run after component renders
}, [dependency]);

Testing:
Run tests:
npm test

Build and Deploy:
Build your app for production:
npm run build
